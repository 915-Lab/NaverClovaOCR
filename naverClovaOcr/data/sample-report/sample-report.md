Summary


Bitumen cargo values gained across Europe and Asia\-Pacific,boosted by a jump in crude and fuel oil values.


Domestic truck prices across Europe also mostlystrengthened as October started.


Cargo premiums to high\-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) in Rot\-terdam and the Baltics fell by $2\-3/t, but outright valuescontinued to rise, while in the Mediterranean premiumvalues were steady on the week as refiners held their groundamid rising outright values and slowing demand.


The Asia\-Pacific bitumen market remained mostly firm,despite the expected slowdown due to the week\-long breakin China for Golden Week holidays.


The continued buoyancy in crude and HSFO prices in theAsia\-Pacific region pushed refiners to either seek price hikesor mull production cuts at their units. Supply for Octoberwas seen to be balanced in key export export locations likeSingapore and South Korea on the back of lower bitumenproduction at some units.


Demand is expected to improve from Vietnam, Australia,China and India in the coming weeks supported by seasonalpick\-up or the easing of pandemic\-related restrictions.


Bitumen prices shot up across sub\-Saharan Africa, withdelivered cargo and drummed import prices racing higher, asdid domestic and export values for South African volumes.

Summary
=======


Domestic truck prices strengthened in several markets,many of those gains linked to monthly revisions for Octobersupplies, while cargo prices also jumped.


While German domestic prices were assessed €10/tfirmer after some price erosion caused by plentiful supplyand high stocks being sold off during September, other keynorthwest European markets like Benelux, UK and Franceregistered €20/t, £20/t and €20\-25/t gains respectively.But not all monthly deals between sellers and buyers hadbeen agreed and confirmed by 1 October, with more detailsexpected from 4 October.


Czech domestic and export prices also strengthenedon tight refinery supply, although there was still plentifulavailability overall in most central and southeast Europeanmarkets.


Sharp gains in fob Rotterdam high\-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO)prices in the last week of September drove up outrightbitumen values, but such gains coupled with early signs ofwinter and demand slowdown in parts of the Nordic/Scandi\-navia region encouraged a modest $2\-3/t slippage in Rot\-terdam and Baltic cargo export premiums to HSFO that wereassessed at $25\-30/t and around $20/t fob respectively.


Cross regional freight rates for standard 5,000t cargoeswere yet to be pushed down significantly, but slim assesseddeclines took Thames\-bound rates to $22\-24/t from Rotter\-dam, $29\-31/t from Hamburg, $47\-49/t from Klaipeda and$39\-43/t from La Coruna.

The market was also being supported by buoyant levelsof construction work and bitumen requirements throughoutSeptember, with suppliers also pointing to healthy orderbooks into October and November.


Bitumen availability from domestic refineries and ter\-minals, buoyed by steady cargo import flows, has also beenhigh, keeping the UK bitumen market broadly balanced.Cargoes delivered into Thames terminals jumped in in thelast week of September to an indicated $495\-500/t (£365\-370/t) cfr range.


UK government data showed domestic bitumen consump\-tion at 156,00t in July, down 6,000t on the same month oflast year. For the May to July period this year consumptionstood at 485,000t, up 59,000t on the same period of 2020\.For year\-to\-date January to July, UK consumption stood at1\.05mn t, against 817,000t last year, after the negative im\-pact on construction activity and demand in 2020 caused byCovid\-19 lockdowns, particularly from March to May.


France
======


French domestic prices rose by €20\-25/t, reflecting sharpgains in agreed prices for the new month of October, al\-though not all supply deal values were yet finalised in discus\-sions between buyers and sellers.


Relatively higher product availability in the north andcentre, as compared with southern France, kept assessedgains in the former regions to €20/t to reach the €475\-485/tdelivered range, while €25/t assessed in the south tookthose values to €445\-455/t delivered. The partial mainte\-nance shutdown since early\-September at the Petroineosrefinery in Lavera on the French Mediterranean coast —expected to last until early November — was a key factorbehind hefty October price hikes, with some domestic

The return to normal production and supply from Exxon\-Mobil's Port\-Jerome refinery in Normandy, northern France,was taking longer than anticipated after the plant was hit bya fire in early September. But both cargo and truck buyerspointed to a steady improvement in the supply position andan anticipated return to normal flows after 4 October.


Benelux
=======


Domestic truck prices in Benelux markets were assessed€20/t firmer at $420\-435/t ex\-works, after October pricehikes following crude and fuel oil gains during September.


While some monthly deals appeared to have been com\-pleted, especially in the Netherlands, with price hikes ofaround €20/t for October supplies versus September values,some talks, especially in Belgium, were expected to takea few more days, with some supplier hikes of up to €40/tbeing sought in ongoing negotiations in a bid to make upfor some of the large gains in crude and HSFO prices duringSeptember, pushing up refinery feedstock costs along with aweakening euro versus dollar.


Local market participants pointed to normal activitylevels for the time of year, with some expecting October tobe the busiest month of the year.


Germany


Modest price gains were registered on the domestic truckmarket, effective from 1 October, after intra\-month declinesduring September when high stocks held by some refineryand terminal locations were being sold off.


Domestic demand has also remained below expectationsfor the season, underlined by fresh German Bafa data thatshowed bitumen deliveries domestically were 211,102t forJuly this year, down 17,000t on the same month of 2020\. Forthe year until July deliveries for Germany domestic con\-sumption were 1\.02mn t, compared to 1\.07mn t in 2020, adrop of 4\.4pc.


Total refinery production of bitumen was 451,969t inJuly, up by 82,359t on the same month of 2020\. For the yearuntil July production stood at 2\.19mn t, compared to 1\.99mnt last year, an increase of 10\.2pc.


Domestic prices were assessed €10/t up at €385\-395/tex\-works in the north, €350\-360/t ex\-works in the northeastand €365\-380/t ex\-works in the southwest.

Some market participants also pointed to the poten\-tial for further price increases in Poland through Octoberas supply from Lotos’ Gdansk refinery was expected to bereduced.


Domestic prices in Poland were indicated as high as€385/t ex\-works, rising sharply by €15\-20/t, while Polishbitumen truck exports to Germany were assessed up €5/t at€345\-355/t ex\-works.

=======================


Regional domestic and export prices were assessed un\-changed, but market participants expected a steady risein demand as well as a hike in some prices, including inRomania, related to crude and fuel oil gains through the restof the month.


Romanian domestic were still assessed at €410\-420/tex\-works, while imports from Poland, which market partici\-pants said were uncompetitive with local Romanian supplies,were also unchanged at €350\-360/t ex\-works. More bitu\-men truck loads were sold by a Greek firm to a Romanianimporter in the week ending 1 October as importers in the

Mediterranean Market coMMentary
===============================


Summary
=======


Mediterranean bitumen cargo prices ended Septemberwith sharp gains as high\-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) prices rosesubstantially, while bitumen cargo premiums stabilised afterdeclining for much of the month.


Spanish export premiums to HSFO were assessed un\-changed at $20\-25/t fob, Greek fob cargo premiums wereassessed unchanged at $15\-20/t, with most Turkish exportflows indicated in the same range, while Italian fob cargopremiums were also assessed unchanged at $15\-20/t. Theimpact of a lack of westbound transatlantic arbitrage op\-portunities, as well as a general demand slowdown withinthe Mediterranean basin was leading to greater availabilitiesacross the region.


Delivered values into key north African markets werefalling, with some delivered premium offers in the low$50’s/t into Algerian terminals in October, although mostindications into Algeria and Morocco were still in the high$50s/t, while delivered Egyptian values for end\-Octoberwere also in the same high $50s/t to HSFO delivered area.


The gains in Mediterranean outright values made it yetmore unprofitable to move spot arbitrage cargoes to the USeast, with Spanish fob levels surging to around $460/t fobduring the last week of September, higher than cif US eastcoast cargoes that were trading around $450/t.


Egyptian state\-refiner EGPC awarded a further 5,000\-6,000t cargo to trading firm BGN at a $57/t delivered pre\-mium, basis Alexandria, for end\-October delivery, additionalto the firm's original four\-cargo tender awarded to PumaEnergy and 3B Trading.


Cross\-Mediterranean freight rates were assessed $1\-2/tdown on shorter routes and $2\-3/t on the longer routesamid clear signs of reduced demand for cargoes as well astankers to move them. That has led to indications, as the

===============================


market enters its usual fourth quarter slowdown period, thata number of tankers are to become open for spot businessfrom around 5 October onwards. While vessel waiting anddischarge lengthy delays at Alexandria, Egypt, mean sometankers are being occupied for longer periods, with Ukraineport delays anyway a feature of the shipping market thisyear, the bearish Mediterranean shipping picture is expectedto cause mounting downward pressures on rates for standard5,000t movements.


The Augusta\-Mohammedia route was assessed $2\-3/tdown at $44\-47/t, with Augusta\-Alexandria and Greece\-Alexandria routes also assessed $2\-3/t weaker at $41\-44/tand $35\-37/t respectively. On the region's shorter routes,$1\-2/t assessed declines took values to $31\-33/t for Tarrago\-na\-Mohammedia, $24\-26/t for Augusta\-Tunisia, $28\-30/t forLivorno\-Tunisia, $25\-27/t for Tarragona\-Ghazaouet and $29\-31/t on Greek ports to Gebze/Mersin, Turkey.

Local suppliers are now looking ahead to whatthey expect to be a fairly busy fourth quarter.


Output from Sonatrach’s Arzew refinery was around400t/day, while some bitutainer volumes were sent fromArzew to Nouakchott, Mauritania, as well as by truck fromsouthern Algerian depots to Niger. The firm is expected tosubstantially boost its overall bitutainer fleet to around 100by the end of October to enable it to expand its regionalexport business.


Several cargoes were heading into Algerian ports aftera slowdown in the rate of imports in September. The 6,180dwt Iver Balance loaded a cargo from Cadiz, Spain, fordischarge into Oran on 30 September, while the 8,021 dwtPoestella loaded a cargo from Augusta, Sicily, for dischargeinto Algiers by 2 October.

The 6,118 dwt Ning Hai Wan loaded a cargo from Huelvafor discharge into Donges, France, on 29 September.


italy
=====


Fob cargo premiums to Mediterranean HSFO prices from Ital\-ian export terminals were assessed unchanged at $15\-20/twith greater availability being indicated by some marketparticipants as regional demand begins to slow down.


Italian domestic demand remained buoyant, but priceswere unchanged going into October, with market partici\-pants anticipating activity and demand to remain steady atstrong levels during much of the fourth quarter.


Strong gains in fuel oil and crude values have been themain driver of upward revisions of domestic Italian values,with some market participants anticipating renewed bitu\-men truck price hikes during October as refiners aim to keeppace with rising crude oil prices.


Domestic truck prices were assessed unchanged in theweek ending 1 October at €390\-400/t ex\-works, includingthe €31/t domestic duty on sales of road paving penetra\-tion grades, while truck export prices into southern Franceas well as Switzerland were indicated around €365\-375/tex\-works.


The 6,165 dwt An Hai Wan loaded a cargo from Tarra\-gona, Spain, for discharge into Naples, while the 5,897 dwtIver Action loaded a cargo from Augusta for discharge intothe southern French port of Lavera by 2 October.


Greece
======


Greek export cargo premiums to fob Mediterranean HSFOcargoes were assessed unchanged at $15\-20/t fob, withmarket participants indicating offers within that range forprompt loadings.


Demand for Greek loading spot cargoes was however thinamid a general downturn in Mediterranean demand headinginto the fourth quarter, while refiners were highly reluctantto allow their spot cargoes to be sold at markedly lower val\-ues than those agreed under their annual contractual dealsfor 2021 supplies.


Domestic Greek truck prices gained significant ground,rising €24/t, with ex\-works offers from Hellenic Petroleum'sAspropyrgos and Thessaloniki refineries at €424/t and€426/t ex\-works respectively, while truck sales from MotorOil Hellas' Agio Theodori refinery were indicated at €424/tex\-works. Trucks continued to be sent into the Romanianmarket, with a Greek firm sending a further 30 trucks intothe country from its storage tanks at Thessaloniki in antici\-pation of pick up in Romania activity and demand by the endof October as money begins to reach more constructors in arush to complete road projects before winter.


The 4,999 dwt Sunpower loaded a cargo from Aspro\-pyrgos for discharge into Mangalia on Romania’s Black Seacoast. The 37,000 dwt Asphalt Synergy loaded a cargo on 22September from Agio Theodori and was located near Gibral\-tar on 1 October, with no end destination as yet clear forits cargo. The 6,065 dwt Fuji Lava was loading a cargo fromAspropyrgos on 30 September, having previously dischargeda cargo into Nikolaev, Ukraine.


turkey
======


Domestic prices in Turkey continued their recent run ofstrength with posted prices at Tupras' refineries surgingTL313\-314/t to TL4,718/t ex\-works Izmit and Izmir refineriesand to TL4,762/t ex\-works Batman and Kirikkale refineries,with those values effective from 28 September.


The rise in prices is in part a result of higher crudevalues and a weakening Turkish Lira, but market participantsalso noted a slowdown in imports from Iraqi Kurdistan andother Iraqi export points, with production lower in partlinked to rising vacuum residue feedstock costs and specifi\-cation issues on some bitumen grades.


Domestic Turkish demand was also picking up pace ina final rush to complete works by constructors before theusual winter halt in activity from December.


A second cargo from the Mideast Gulf is expected in thecoming weeks into the Toros Gubre terminal at Ceyhan, withas yet no clear indication of which tanker is to make thatjourney or any firm shipment dates.

Summary
=======


Bitumen prices shot up across sub\-Saharan Africa, with deliv\-ered cargo and drummed import prices racing higher, as diddomestic and export values for South African volumes.


The demand picture was fairly buoyant in several south\-ern and east African markets, while the rainy season wasstill keeping a lid on west African activity rates.


West Africa
===========


Cargo prices for delivery into regional import terminalssurged as a renewed spike in crude and high\-sulphur fuel oil(HSFO) prices drove up outright bitumen values.


Spanish and Ivory Coast cargo premiums to fob Mediter\-ranean HSFO cargoes were assessed unchanged at $20\-25/tand around $115/t fob respectively after recent declines andamid marked reluctance amongst major European refinerysuppliers to export product at yet lower premiums thanunder their existing contractual arrangements for 2021 sales.


Freight rate assessments for standard 5,000t spot cargomovements from Spanish to Nigerian ports stayed in the$150\-160/t range, but mounting downward pressures oncross\-Mediterranean rates could exert similar pressure onwest Africa\-bound and intra\-regional freight rates over thecoming weeks.


West African construction activity and bitumen demandlevels remained subdued as rainy season conditions saw nosign of letting up. The greatest concentration of rainfallaffecting the southern and western parts of the region, prin\-cipally Nigeria, Cameroon, Ivory Coast and Ghana.

pect of any deliveries into that market, Naftal had sent itsfirst 300t bitutainer volume to Nouakchott for the Maurita\-nian market in late\-August, also from Arzew. Naftal, whichis in the process of expanding its fleet of bitutainers build byan Algerian firm, has also been supplying small\-scale bitut\-ainer volumes into Niger from its depots in southern Algeria.


Nigeria
=======


Nigerian bitumen stocks remained at high levels after anumber of cargo deliveries into its terminals during Septem\-ber at a time of weak demand amid continued and intensiverainy season conditions.


The latest data released by the country's PetroleumProducts Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) showed stocksof the product stood on 30 September at 31,106,384 litres(31,707t), down slightly from a peak of 31,906,036 litres(32,523t) on 22 September but still 26pc up from the 1 Sep\-tember level of 24,729,625 litres (25,208t).


The 5,076 dwt Jane Asphalt arrived at the Abidjan ter\-minal in Ivory Coast to load its next cargo for delivery intoGradient Energy's Warri terminal in Nigeria's Delta State.All previous cargo shipments on board the tanker into theGradient terminal during 2021 have been made from Spanishexport terminals at Huelva, Tarragona and Cadiz, as well asone February cargo movement from Augusta, Sicily.


The 11,406 dwt Biskra was still located off Port Harcourton 29 September, having arrived there on 23 September withthe second of its two\-port discharges, the first having beeninto Sapele.

delayed its 6,00t bitumen terminal project in the Tema portarea.


The $35mn project in a joint venture with Ivory Coastbitumen producer SMB, also includes a 30t/hour capacitystyrene\-butadiene\-styrene (SBS) polymer\-modified bitumen(PMB) plant as well as a 60t/hr emulsions unit. The proj\-ect had been slated for end\-September completion, but isnow being targeted to be ready at the end of this year (seenews).


Virtually all of Ghana's bulk cargo imports are currentlymade into its Takoradi terminal, mainly from SMB's Abidjanrefinery and terminal complex, with Shell and Total receiv\-ing those volumes of AC\-10 and AC\-20 and selling them tolocal truck buyers.


The 4,900 dwt SMB time\-chartered San Biagio moved acargo from the firm's Abidjan refinery and terminal com\-plex to Douala, Cameroon, arriving there on 29 September.Armed guards on board was indicated by vessel trackingservices, underlining the continued security risks associatedwith shipping movements in the Gulf of Guinea.


East Africa
===========


Regional import prices for both drummed and bulk bitumenimports from the Mideast Gulf maintained their upward mo\-mentum amid gains in both fob and delivered prices.


The sharpest gains affected the Iranian drummed exporttrade to east African ports, with Iranian exports assessed$16/t up at $365\-380/t fob Bandar Abbas, while freight ratesfrom Bandar Abbas to Mombasa, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam,Tanzania, were assessed $10/t up at $95\-100/t amid relent\-less gains in container shipping costs caused by global short\-age in that sector.


Market participants reported price indications into Kenyaat values anywhere from $460/t up to the $475\-485/t cfrMombasa range for direct shipments from Bandar Abbas andas high as $650\-660/t for indirect flows via Jebel Ali.


Regional suppliers said Iranian state\-owned IRISL and itsHDS affiliate had raised direct shipping rates from BandarAbbas to Mombasa and Dar es Salaam to $1,850\-1,950 percontainer ($90\-100/t), while some east Africa bound move\-ments made indirectly by international container ship\-ping lines were indicated as high as $5,000 per container($250/t).


Market participants named several such lines that wereoffering little or no services on Mideast Gulf to east andother sub\-Saharan Africa routes.


Assessed freight rates from Bandar Abbas to Djiboutiwere also $10/t firmer at $185\-190/t given that the route can

only be served by international shipping lines moving movesin directly via UAE ports, principally Jebel Ali.


Iranian bulk cargo exports were assessed $10\-11/t up at$290\-305/t fob Bandar Abbas, while Bahraini state\-owned re\-finer Bapco announced it would raise its listed cargo exportprice by $15/t to $440/t fob Sitra with effect from 2 Octoberin the wake of two sets of hikes over the past month.


kenya/Uganda/South Sudan
========================


Regional suppliers pointed to more busy rates of construc\-tion activity and bitumen requirements in Kenya, Ugandaand South Sudan.


While supply of Iranian drummed bitumen remains tightamid container shipping and container shortages as well asregular delays in such shipping movements, especially on Ira\-nian state\-owned IRISL vessels, bulk cargo supply movementshave helped to alleviate some of the availability issues ineast African markets.


The 3,764 dwt R Ocean was set to deliver its bulk cargointo the Skytrade Global terminal in Mombasa after itsscheduled 10 October arrival with its cargo loaded in theMideast Gulf, following the previous 30 August deliveryon the same tanker. While nearly all the volumes in theprevious shipment have already been delivered to local andregional buyers, around half of the new shipment's volumewas understood to have already been pre\-sold by the weekending 1 October.


Domestic drummed and bulk truck prices were expectedto face upward pressure because of the spike in deliveredvalues into Mombasa, Kenya. Bulk truck volumes wereindicated at Kenyan Shillings 71\-73/kg ($642\-660/t) ex\-worksMombasa, while drummed sales were at KES73\-74/kg ($660\-669/t) and expected to rise in early October to as high asKES75/kg ($679/t).

Southern Africa


South African domestic and truck export prices jumped,with some of the export flows now indicated at around Rand8,300/t ($550\-560/t) ex\-works.


A steady stream of requirements was reported into Zam\-bia, Malawi and Botswana, with drummed flows also headinginto Zimbabwe from neighbouring South Africa.


South Africa


Domestic truck prices shot up as South African refiners dra\-matically raised their prices to reflect large gains in crudeand other feedstock costs during September as well as aweakening Rand against the US dollar.


Gains of R700\-800/t from some suppliers were reportedby market participants to have already taken effect from1 October, with assessments rising R750/t to the R9,200\-9,600/t ex\-works range.


Rates of construction activity have been rising during thecurrent peak season period that began on 1 September, withbuoyant rates of project work reported in KwaZulu\-Nataland Eastern Cape provinces. Some of that work is con\-nected with construction of the multi\-billion Rand Msikabaand Mtentu bridges that will form part of the N2 Wild Coastmega road project. Funding allocations for the next roundof South African National Roads Authority (Sanral) backedprojects was awaited, with those projects most likely tostart sometime in 2022\.

Singapore
=========


Singapore bitumen prices edged up another $5/t this week,supported by stronger deals and discussions among localsellers and regional buyers.


On a fob Singapore basis, a key trader sold about 15,000tin total to Indonesian buyers at $410/t for November\-loading.Several deals for October loading were also concluded atabout $405\-410/t levels. Two more deals to be loaded inend\-October were also concluded into Vietnam on a cfrbasis, with fob values at $405\-410/t.


Offers from refiners and local traders ranged at $415\-425/t for late\-October/early\-November loading cargoes thatmet bids or buying indications in the $405\-410/t range.


Supply from Singapore is expected to be more balancedin October on the back of production loss from 2\-3 keyrefiners. The persistent negative spread between bitumenand high\-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) could be pushing refiners toincentivise production of HSFO versus bitumen.


Tank truck prices from Singapore have continued to riseand were at $406\-415/t ex\-refinery. Demand in Malaysia hasbeen slowing again from the central region of PeninsularMalaysia, following the recent pick\-up.


Prices of tank trucks from Singapore jumped to around$415\-430/t ex\-refinery. Regional players have also noted thattighter bitumen supply across Singapore and Malaysia hasresulted in higher prices for tank trucks. An offer into Johorewas at around 1920 ringgit/t ($456/t) on a delivered basis.


Domestic prices in Singapore were raised by $20\.50/t to$420\-445/t ex\-tank for October on the back of higher crudevalues in the past month. Domestic demand is expectedto however remain flat against September, with manpowerlimitations and expected wet weather to hamper works.

Malaysia
========


Bitumen demand in Malaysia was stable\-to\-firm as most con\-struction projects across the country continued to operateat a steady pace.


Demand from the Klang Valley continued to occupy alarge share of total volumes lifted, with bitumen demandfrom ongoing projects and premix plants remaining firm overthe past three weeks.


The state\-owned refiner increased its tank truck pricesto around 1,830\-1,880 ringgit/t ex\-Malacca ($437\-449/t).Prices from Port Klang rose similarly to around 1,870\-1,900/tex\-Klang ($447\-454/t). Delivered prices in the north havealso edged up to around 1,870\-1960 ringgit/t ($447\-466/t) inresponse an increase in listed prices from the state\-ownedrefiner’s Prai facility.


Several players have expressed that erratic rainfallover several construction sites has affected the progressof projects, but demand across Peninsula Malaysia in thecoming months is expected to remain firm as most construc\-tion projects continue to edge towards completion by endNovember.


Thailand


Prices on a fob basis were assessed at $395\-405/t in linewith the trend seen in Singapore.

A deal for a 2,000\-3,000t cargo bound for central Viet\-nam, with a laycan period set in the first week of November,was at around $395\-400/t fob.


Regional traders have noted firmer buying indicationsfrom Vietnamese buyers for end October and first half No\-vember\-loading cargoes. Demand from Vietnam is expectedto pick up in November, as the seasonal monsoon ends.


Domestic demand for bitumen was mostly muted. Floodsacross several regions in Thailand after tropical stormDianmu has hit operations in multiple construction sites inBangkok and other parts of central Thailand.


Domestic prices rose to around $490\-550/t ex\-refinery inresponse to higher crude prices. The higher cost of produc\-tion has necessitated an increase in its listed prices.


indonesia
=========


Bitumen demand in Indonesia continued to strengthen as thecountry approached its annual peak season for the bitumenmarket. Demand from the islands of Sumatra, Kalimantanand Sulawesi continued to be relatively firm on the back ofongoing projects.


A deal for a 1,500t Singapore origin cargo bound forKalimantan with a loading period set in first half Octoberwas at above $430/t cfr Kalimantan. A 3,000t 1H Octoberloading cargo bound for North Sulawesi was concluded ataround $440/t cfr. Another deal for a 3,000t lot for first halfOctober loading to South Sumatra was concluded at around$440/t cfr. A deal by a Singapore\-based trader totalling up to15,000t to be loaded across November and first half Decem\-ber was also done this week.


Buying ideas were in the $395\-410/t fob range for endOctober and early November loading cargoes. Most regionalplayers have continued to indicate their preference for

An importer concluded two October loading cargoes fromnorth Asia at $440\-445/t cfr, with one small volume loadingfor south Vietnam from Thailand and another 5,000t cargo tonorth Vietnam.


Two 3,000t cargoes from Singapore were concluded at$440/t cfr south Vietnam and $455/t cfr north Vietnam. Thiscould not be confirmed with the buyer. Freight costs wereestimated at $30\-35/t to south Vietnam and $45\-50/t tonorth Vietnam.

The cargo was under\-stood to be part of a larger shipment heading towards thenorth in end\-October. Other offers into Vietnam for second\-half October volumes were ranging between $445\-455/t cfrfor cargoes of both southeast Asian and northeast Asia ori\-gins, with most buying ideas at $440\-445/t cfr.

On a fob South Korea basis, no sell tenders were award\-ed. But a key refiner is expected to open a sell tender forits November loading cargoes in the coming weeks. Demandfrom China remains weak and is anticipated to remain abearish factor for the Korean sellers.


Meanwhile, some key refineries are continuing to produceless bitumen on the back of strong HSFO economics. Thereduced physical volumes of bitumen has helped to balancethe overall supply availability for October.


Domestic prices in South Korea were raised by $51/t forOctober, as recent firmness in crude values lent to higherdomestic selling prices. Demand outlook for October remainsslightly mixed, with local players wary of the recent spikein Covid\-19 cases following the Thanksgiving festival holidayrecently.


In Japan, domestic prices were raised by ¥1,000/t to¥63,513\-71,619/t ex\-tank. Demand in September has beenmostly stable against the previous month. More roadworksare expected to commence in October, though some proj\-ects might slow down with the upcoming general electionsin November. Some sellers were anticipating slightly tightersupply in October, with one refiner’s terminal in Yokohamaundergoing maintenance. This could not be confirmed.


taiwan
======


In line with regional price movements, export prices fromTaiwan were assessed $2\.50/t higher to $400\-405/t fobTaiwan.


Volumes from the private refiner remain limited, withno indications given on production levels for November andDecember.


Reduced volumes have also prompted buyers to seekalternative cargoes of other origins.Domestic prices from the state\-owned refiner were un\-changed at NT17,000/t ex\-tank.


china


Limited negotiations were seen in China with the countryheading into the week\-long break for Golden Week celebra\-tions from 1\-7 October.


A key state\-owned refiner raised its domestic listedprices by 20\-70 yuan/t for key refineries in east China andby 50 yuan/t for refineries in the south. The upward revi\-sions were seen as mostly in line with the firmness in globalcrude prices, with domestic demand expected to improvepost\-Golden Week. Another smaller state\-owned refineralso raised listed prices by 230 yuan/t at its terminal in thesouthwest.


Ongoing power shortages in parts of China had limitedimpact on production. Some refineries in areas affected bypower shortages may have slowed the rate of production,but supply levels were mostly unaffected.


A state\-owned refinery in Shandong also resumed opera\-tions on 25 September after a planned turnaround. Tworefineries in the east and in the south are due to undergo amonth\-long maintenance from October. Overall supply levelsare expected to remain ample with the refiner planning toraise overall bitumen production by about 50,000\-100,000tin October. The planned increment comes on the back of re\-duced petroleum coke production which has been curtaileddue to carbon emission reduction plans.


Few discussions for imported cargoes were seen with

most buyers preferring to delay negotiations until after 8October. In east China, an offer for an October\-loading SouthKorean cargo was at 3,250 yuan/t. About 7,000t of October\-loading cargo from South Korea were also concluded at3,300\-3,350 yuan/t to east China. This could not be con\-firmed. Another importer concluded a very prompt 5,000South Korean cargo which loaded this week at $424/t cfreast China.


In south China, no firm discussions for imports wereseen amid scant buying interest. An offer for November andDecember\-loading cargoes from a Singapore\-based refinerwas made at $460/t cfr south China.


Higher freight rates were quoted for cargoes from SouthKorea to east China, with ship owners having to contendwith higher demurrage fees due to ongoing port congestion,particularly along the Yangtze River. Freight rates were at$38\-45/t for 5,000t cargoes, though few to no buyers werewilling to take the higher offers.


Australia \& New Zealand
========================


In the state of Victoria, the ongoing construction sectorshutdown in Melbourne and other areas will be lifted from 5October, with stringent Covid\-19 measures in place. One sell\-er estimated a reduction of around 50pc of sales this weekdue to the shutdown, with some slowdown also attributedto the wet weather. Overall demand is expected to pick upgradually in October and firm further in November.


Discussions were ongoing for November\-loading cargoes,with indicative offers at higher than current fob Singaporelevels. One importer also concluded a 7,000t cargo fromsoutheast Asia for loading mid\-November on a formula basis.


In New Zealand, demand from Auckland is expected toreach similar levels to the rest of the country gradually, withroadworks picking up despite the city remaining under thestricter “level 3” Covid\-19 measures. Ullage levels remainmanageable with importers citing no need to delay or divertincoming cargoes.


India
=====


In the Indian market, demand is slowly returning as themonsoon is nearing its end. Roadworks are picking up slowlyin parts of the country with the monsoon expected to end inanother 10 days time.


Buying of bulk and drummed parcels from Iran picked upthis week but port inventories remain on the high side, thusdeterring a firm upturn. Local refiners also raised prices forbulk by 1,600 Indian rupees/t and for drummed cargoes by2,600 Indian rupees/t from 1 October.

ply by refineries and expectations of further rise in pricesin the coming revision, led by hikes in crude and HSFOprices. About 202,000t demand registered for VB feed, while103,000t was sold by refineries on IME this week.

Narrow margins pressure Iran's bitumen
======================================


Iranian bitumen production fell by an estimated 22pc duringMarch\-August, faced by the double whammy of higher costsof production and weak demand from key markets.


Iran's VB feed sales volume fell by about 22pc from2\.962mn t to 2\.314mn t between 22 March and 22 August2021 compared with the same period last year. As a result,bitumen production also fell by at least about 22pc duringthe same period.


Meanwhile, bitumen sellers have seen weak demand indomestic as well as regional markets. Producers have alsoseen an increasing squeeze on margins on the rising cost ofVB feed prices. This, coupled with stronger high\-sulphur fueloil (HSFO) economics, has resulted in higher production offuel oil and has reduced export volumes.


“We reduced trading activities for bitumen as there isno profit margin, and have switched to other products,” saidseveral local traders.


“As a producer, we have faced losses over the pastmonths and were forced to sell our cargoes only to pay ourdebts from purchasing VB feed that was bought earlier,” saidseveral producers.


As a result, the number of companies trading or sellingbitumen within Iran has fallen over the past few months.


A gap was seen in buy\-sell expectations as higher offersbased on higher costs of production were rejected by buy\-ers from key markets. This was further underpinned by theimpact of Covid\-19, which resulted in issues with governmentfunds and slowed paving activities in recent months.


“We purchased VB feed at 70,274 rials/kg \[$285/t] andproduced bitumen at $315/t fob, including storage and VATcosts, but we have sold without any profit,” said industryparticipants. The government did not give a tax rebate to

many exporters in the past two years and imposed a bitu\-men export tax from March 2021 onwards.


VB feed supply fell by 21pc from 3\.24mn t to 2\.56mn tbetween 22 March and 22 August this year. This was sup\-ported by a possible move by Iranian refineries to increasefuel oil production because of higher demand, in contrast toweak demand from bitumen producers.


On the other hand, Iran's bitumen exports in August slidby 32pc compared with a month earlier and was 48pc loweryear\-on\-year amid low demand from Asian markets. Exportsfell to about 221,730t in August, down from 326,000t soldin July. Meanwhile Iran’s export sales stood at 431,000t inAugust 2020, according to data from the Iran MercantileExchange.


Vietnam’s bitumen demand to rise
================================


Bitumen demand from Vietnam looks set to increase in thenext few years, supported by an ambitious road develop\-ment plan that seeks to construct over 5,000km of express\-ways between 2021\-2030\.


The Road Network Development Plan which was unveiledthis month seeks to develop over 5,000km of expressways inthe country by 2030, up from 3,841km in 2021\.


Key areas for expressway development include exten\-sions to the ongoing North\-South Expressway project, as wellas the 14 expressways in the north, which alone would totalabout 2,305km. It also includes 10 expressways making uparound 1,431km in the central and central highlands region,and another 10 expressways totalling around 1,290km in thesouth.


On top of the new additions to the expressways, thereare also plans for 172 national highway routes totalling

29,795km by 2030, and 3,034km of coastal roads spanning 28cities and provinces.


The road development plan is one of the five masterblueprints for the country’s transport sector, which includeplans for high\-speed rail routes, sea ports and new inter\-national airports to be constructed between this year and2030\. The investment capital for the plan is estimated to beabout 900,000bn dong ($39\.6bn), according to a draft issuedby Vietnam’s Ministry of Transport. The bulk of the projectfunding is expected to come from public\-private partnership(PPP) investment.

Vietnam does not produce bitumen, which is used inroad construction. The country imported close to 890,000tof bitumen in 2020, the highest in the last five years. Newroad construction projects are expected to continue as thegovernment pushes for infrastructure development in tan\-dem with economic goals, and has positioned Vietnam as anattractive business hub.


The road development plan is also aligned with Vietnam’s11th Socio\-Economic Development Plan (SEDP), which coversthe period of 2021\-2025 and includes the goal of achievingan average Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 6\.5\-7pc in thenext five years.


Ghana's new bitumen terminal delayed


Ghanaian state\-owned oil and gas marketing firm Goil haspushed back the completion date for a new $35mn bitumenterminal and conversion project at the port of Tema to theend of this year.


The 6,000t terminal — which will supply imported AC\-10and AC\-20 bitumen performance grades to newly built poly\-mer\-modified bitumen (PMB) and bitumen emulsions plants— had been slated for completion by the end of this month.Covid\-related issues are understood to be partly responsiblefor the delay.


Goil's joint venture partner in the project is Ivory Coastbitumen producer and exporter SMB, which has 300,000 t/yrof bitumen production capacity at its Abidjan refinery. Theproject was announced in 2017 and construction work begantwo years later. It is now 94pc complete.


Once operations start, bitumen imports into Tema will befed to the terminal by a 3km pipeline, which will be electri\-cally heated to keep the road paving product liquid before itis discharged into Goil's newly built storage tanks.


The imported bitumen will then feed into the styrene\-butadiene\-styrene PMB plant, which will have the capacityto produce 30 t/hour. Some local market participants expectincreased use of PMB in major road and highway projects inGhana over the coming years.


One domestic construction sector player said its use hadyet to be pursued aggressively by the country's highways au\-thorities. The bitumen emulsions plant will have a capacityof 60 t/hr. Bitumen emulsions are already in much wider usein Ghana than PMB.

Germany's Schwedt refinery completes restart
============================================


German refinery consortium PCK has completed the restartof its 208,000 b/d Schwedt refinery in north eastern Ger\-many.


The plant is ramping up production in order to reach a80\-100pc utilisation rate. Repair works on a high conversionsoaker cracking (HSC) unit will last until mid\-October, ac\-cording to one of the refinery's shareholders.


The PCK consortium comprises Russia's state\-controlledRosneft, Shell and Italian energy firm Eni.


The facility was shut down by a regional electricityfailure on 8 September. PCK began restart operations on thesame day, but warned at the time that the process wouldtake several days.


Bahrain's Bapco raises bitumen prices by $15/t
==============================================


Bahrain’s state\-owned refiner Bapco will increase its bitu\-men listed prices by $15/t from 2 October on the back ofhigher crude and fuel oil prices.


This price hike will see listed prices increase to $440/tfob Sitra. This is the third time in a month Bapco has an\-nounced a price increase. It raised listed prices by $20/ton two occasions, first on 11 September and again on 19September.


Hikes in high\-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) prices have prompt\-ed regional refiners to switch to producing HSFO over bitu\-men.


Romania's Midia refinery back to 'optimal'

The refinery had been offline since early\-July because ofa fire, which killed three people and injured two others.


Rompetrol Rafinare is performing the last technicalchecks to resume production and Midia's installations will berestarted in stages. The operator of the refinery said thatit is currently in the phase of starting up petrol and dieselproduction units.


Midia was previously expected to start on 20\-24 Septem\-ber. The plant already supplied some raw material to Rom\-petrol Rafinare's Vega bitumen plant in Ploiesti last week,suggesting some units were operating, but the operatordeclined to say whether the restarting process began then.


Midia's diesel hydrotreatment unit, where the fire brokeout in July, has been “technologically isolated” and its re\-pairs and restart is scheduled for 2022, the company said.


The fire also affected the kerosene hydrotreater andcatalytic reformer units, along with nearby pipes connectedto the naphtha hydrotreater and saturated gases units, thecompany said last month.


BTK’s bitumen terminal to be upgraded


Bunkering company Baltic Fuel (BTK) has secured Rbs1bn($14mn) of financing for a two\-phase project to increasebitumen loadings at its Turukhtannye Ostrova terminal at StPetersburg port.


BTK subsidiary Kontur reached a six\-year loan agreementwith St Petersburg Bank for the project, which aims to add43,800m³ of storage and increase loading capacity for bitu\-men and vacuum residue — a feedstock for bitumen produc\-tion — as well as providing facilities to manufacture polymer\-modified bitumen. Turukhtannye Ostrova has capacity tohandle about 1\.8mn t/yr of products, mainly fuel oil andgasoil, and more than 80,000m³ of tank\-farm space — around
